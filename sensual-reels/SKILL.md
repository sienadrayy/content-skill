# Sensual Reels 🔥

Generate stunning, hot Instagram Reel scripts in seconds. No briefs needed—just ask, and you'll get complete scripts with sensual concepts ready to film.

## How It Works

Every time you ask for a script, you get:

1. **Timeline Script** - Exactly 60 seconds of cinematic direction with timestamps, movements, and visual cues
2. **Concept Details** - Angles, lighting, styling, props, and poses designed for maximum visual impact
3. **Multiple Options** - 2-3 variations so you can pick the vibe that fits

**Priority:** Every script prioritizes hot, revealing, sensual content within Instagram's platform guidelines.

## Quick Start

**Just ask:** "Generate a script" or "Script for today"

You'll receive:

```
TIMELINE SCRIPT
[0-2s] Hook description
[2-15s] Build phase
[15-45s] Main moment
[45-58s] Engagement phase
[58-60s] Outro/CTA

CONCEPT
- Styling: [outfit details]
- Angles: [camera positioning]
- Lighting: [mood and setup]
- Poses: [key moments and movements]
- Vibe: [overall energy]
```

## Sensual Content Standards

When generating scripts, always apply the patterns in `references/sensual-patterns.md`. These ensure content is:

✅ **Extremely hot & revealing** (8-9/10 intensity)  
✅ **Aesthetically stunning** - professional, not trashy  
✅ **Instagram platform-compliant** - stays within guidelines  
✅ **Engagement-optimized** - designed to get saves, shares, comments  

See `references/sensual-patterns.md` for detailed guidance on angles, poses, transitions, and styling that maximize visual impact.

## Concept Library

Use `references/concepts.md` for inspiration on:
- Classic poses (side profile, shoulder glance, body roll)
- Camera angles (close-up focus, tracking shots, overhead)
- Lighting setups (natural, golden hour, moody)
- Styling combinations (minimal, accessories, texture)
- Transitional moves (outfit changes, location shifts, pose sequences)

## Example Script

```
SCRIPT: BEDROOM CONFIDENCE
[0-2s] HOOK: Close-up face, sultry eye contact, slow blink, soft lighting
[2-12s] BUILD: Pan down to shoulder, minimal clothing visible, confident posture
[12-35s] MAIN: Slow body movement, highlight curves, confident strut or recline
[35-55s] MOMENT: Direct camera look, subtle smile/lip bite, peak sensual energy
[55-58s] ENGAGEMENT: Flick of hair or clothing adjustment, break eye contact playfully
[58-60s] END: Logo reveal or text overlay

CONCEPT
- Styling: Silk/satin material, minimal jewelry
- Angles: 45° side angle for maximum silhouette, then direct to camera
- Lighting: Soft golden + subtle rim light
- Poses: Reclined confidence, intentional slow movements
- Vibe: Alluring, self-assured, magnetic
```

## Tips for Best Results

- **Timing is everything** - Every script uses the full 60 seconds for maximum impact
- **Confidence over technique** - The energy matters more than perfect execution
- **Use multiple takes** - Capture variations of each moment to edit best ones
- **Lighting is key** - Most sensual content works best with flattering, warm lighting
