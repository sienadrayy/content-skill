# Narrative Progression Patterns

**CRITICAL:** Every script must show VALUABLE PROGRESS toward a goal. Not just body movements. Not random camera angles.

## Core Concept: The Progress Arc

Every 60-second script follows this arc:

```
[0-10s] SETUP - Define scene, outfit state, what's about to happen
[10-30s] PROGRESSION - Show progress toward goal, outfit/scene changes
[30-50s] CLIMAX - Peak moment of the progression, fully ready/complete
[50-60s] FINALE - Confidence in completed state, power moment
```

**NOT:** "slow movements" or "camera angles"  
**YES:** Actual progression showing what's being achieved

---

## Narrative Formula

Every moment must specify:
1. **Scene State** - Where? What's the setting? (bathroom, bedroom, vanity, etc.)
2. **Outfit/Styling State** - What's visible? What level of readiness? (no makeup → full makeup, undressed → fully dressed, etc.)
3. **Action** - What's actively happening? (applying makeup, putting on dress, adjusting fit, etc.)
4. **Visual Emphasis** - What shows the progress? (makeup brush, dress being pulled on, full outfit visible, etc.)

## Scene Consistency Rules

**CRITICAL for all scripts:**

1. **Single Scene Throughout (Unless Intentional Transition)**
   - If GRWM: Bathroom OR bedroom (not bouncing between)
   - If Shower: Same shower/bathroom throughout
   - If Lingerie: Same bedroom throughout
   - Consistency = feels like one coherent moment, not random cuts

2. **Lighting Consistency**
   - Define lighting once: "warm golden bathroom light" or "soft bedroom window light"
   - Maintain throughout script
   - Don't change lighting between segments (breaks immersion)

3. **Outfit Progression is Linear**
   - Start: One state (fully clothed, no makeup, etc.)
   - Middle: Transitional states (partially undressed, makeup partial, etc.)
   - End: Final state (fully ready, minimal coverage, complete look)
   - Never regress (don't go from dressed → undressed → dressed again)

4. **Mirror/Reflection Usage**
   - If using mirror: Show both mirror AND direct camera views
   - Mirror shots = seeing yourself
   - Direct camera = seeing you
   - Both build engagement without breaking scene consistency

[45-55s] CLIMAX - Fully ready/complete

```

## What Makes Progress Valuable

❌ **NOT valuable progress:**
- Different camera angles of same moment
- Body movements without context
- Random outfit changes with no narrative
- "Sensual movements" without story

✅ **VALUABLE progress:**
- Makeup application → visible makeup appears
- Undressing → less coverage visible
- Dressing → more coverage/completion visible
- Jewelry addition → accessories visible being added
- State changes → clear before/after visible
- Confidence building → expression + body language shift

---

## Scene State Examples

### Makeup States (GRWM)
- Fresh face (no makeup)
- Eyes done (eyeshadow + eyeliner visible)
- Full face (eyes + lips + contouring visible)
- Final makeup (all complete, glowing)

### Outfit States (Lingerie Try-On)
- Casual clothes (jeans, shirt)
- First lingerie piece (bra or top visible)
- Partial set (bra + partial bottoms)
- Complete lingerie set (full piece visible)
- Lingerie + robe/accessory (final look)

### Water States (Shower)
- Dry, clothed (before shower)
- Wet, undressing (transitioning)
- Soaked, minimal (shower moment)
- Water cascading (peak shower)
- Towel, drying (post-shower)

## Camera Strategy for Progression

Instead of random angles, use:

1. **Close-up detail** - Show what's being applied/adjusted (makeup brush, zipper, etc.)
2. **Medium shot** - Show outfit/scene state
3. **Full body** - Show complete progression
4. **Mirror/reflection** - Show self-view moment
5. **Direct camera** - Show confidence/power moment

**Flow:** Detail → Scene → Full → Confidence

This shows the progression while building engagement.
