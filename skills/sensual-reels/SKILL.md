# Sensual Reels - NARRATIVE PROGRESSION FOCUSED 🔥

Generate Instagram Reel scripts with VALUABLE PROGRESS and scene consistency. Not random body movements—clear narrative arcs showing actual progression.

## How It Works - NARRATIVE PROGRESSION FOCUSED

Every time you ask for a script, you get:

1. **Timeline Script** - 60 seconds showing CLEAR NARRATIVE PROGRESSION
   - Setup [0-10s]: Define scene, outfit state, starting action
   - Progression [10-30s]: Show active change/progress toward goal (makeup being applied, clothes coming off, outfit going on, etc.)
   - Climax [30-50s]: Peak moment of achieved state (fully ready, fully undressed, fully in outfit, etc.)
   - Finale [50-60s]: Power confirmation of complete state

2. **Concept Details** - Scene consistency, outfit progression, and sensual emphasis through purpose
   - Same scene throughout (not jumping between locations)
   - Outfit progression clearly visible (starting state → ending state)
   - Lighting consistency (same color temp throughout)
   - Poses/movements that show progress (not random camera angles)

3. **Narrative Arc** - Every script tells a complete story
   - Clear goal (get ready, shower, try on lingerie, etc.)
   - Visual evidence of progress (makeup visible being applied, water visible cascading, dress visible being put on)
   - Confidence building throughout
   - Satisfying conclusion

**Priority:** Every script shows VALUABLE PROGRESS with scene consistency and sensuality through NARRATIVE PURPOSE, not just skin exposure.

## Quick Start

**Just ask:** "Generate a script" or "Script for today" or "3 part shower" 

### Single Script
```
TIMELINE SCRIPT (60 seconds)
[0-2s] Hook description
[2-15s] Build phase
[15-45s] Main moment
[45-58s] Engagement phase
[58-60s] Outro/CTA

CONCEPT
- Styling: [outfit details]
- Angles: [camera positioning]
- Lighting: [mood and setup]
- Poses: [key moments and movements]
- Vibe: [overall energy]
```

### Multi-Part Scripts (e.g., "3 parts")
When you say "3 parts", you get **3 SEPARATE scripts** (each 15-20 sec for distinct image/video)

**CRITICAL:** "3 parts" = 3 INDEPENDENT scripts, not 1 script divided into 3 sections.
- Each part is a distinct concept/moment
- Each part generates 1 image + 1 video (4 seconds)
- Each part should be visually different but thematically connected

```
PART 1 SCRIPT (15-20 sec)
[0-3s] Hook
[3-15s] Build
[15-20s] Peak moment
Concept: [distinct moment 1]
Styling/Angle/Lighting: [specific to part 1]

PART 2 SCRIPT (15-20 sec)
[0-3s] Hook
[3-15s] Build
[15-20s] Peak moment
Concept: [distinct moment 2]
Styling/Angle/Lighting: [specific to part 2]

PART 3 SCRIPT (15-20 sec)
[0-3s] Hook
[3-15s] Build
[15-20s] Peak moment
Concept: [distinct moment 3]
Styling/Angle/Lighting: [specific to part 3]

OUTPUT:
- 3 separate image prompts (one per part)
- 3 separate video prompts (one per part)
- 3 images total
- 3 videos total (4 sec each)
```

## Sensual Content Standards - NARRATIVE PROGRESSION FOCUSED

When generating scripts, always apply the patterns in `references/sensual-patterns.md` and `references/narrative-progression.md`. These ensure content is:

✅ **Narrative-driven** - Clear progression toward a goal (GRWM → ready, Shower → undressing, Lingerie → trying on)  
✅ **Scene-consistent** - Same location and lighting throughout (not jumping between scenes)  
✅ **Outfit/State progression** - Visible progression from starting state to final state (makeup visible being applied, clothes visible coming off, etc.)  
✅ **Action-focused** - Actions that show progress (not just poses) - applying makeup, removing clothes, putting on outfit, etc.  
✅ **Hot & sensual** (8-9/10 intensity) - Sensuality through purpose and confidence, not just skin exposure  
✅ **Specific & detailed** - Not vague, every moment has clear purpose in the narrative  
✅ **Confidence-building** - Expression and energy escalate throughout (from anticipation → focus → confidence → power)  
✅ **Instagram platform-compliant** - Stays within guidelines  
✅ **Engagement-optimized** - Tells a story viewers connect with and want to save/share  

### Key Principles (Feb 2026 Rebuild)
- **Narrative matters:** Scripts show PROGRESS, not random poses
- **Scene consistency:** Same bathroom, same bedroom, same shower throughout (not random scene changes)
- **Outfit progression:** Clear visible progression from state 1 → state 2 → state 3 (not confusing changes)
- **Specific actions:** "Apply eyeshadow with visible brush motion [5s]" not "sensual movements"
- **Confidence arc:** Energy and expression build from setup → climax → finale
- **Quality checklist:** All scripts must pass sensual-patterns.md Script Generation Checklist (narrative gates)

See `references/sensual-patterns.md` and `references/narrative-progression.md` for:
- Narrative Progression Patterns (Setup → Progression → Climax → Finale structure)
- Scene Consistency Rules (same location, lighting, outfit progression)
- Timeline Structure (explicit setup, progression, climax, finale with specific states)
- Script Generation Checklist (narrative progression quality gates, not body-reveal gates)

## Concept Library

Use `references/concepts.md` for inspiration on:
- Classic poses (side profile, shoulder glance, body roll)
- Camera angles (close-up focus, tracking shots, overhead)
- Lighting setups (natural, golden hour, moody)
- Styling combinations (minimal, accessories, texture)
- Transitional moves (outfit changes, location shifts, pose sequences)

## Example Script

```
SCRIPT: BEDROOM CONFIDENCE
[0-2s] HOOK: Close-up face, sultry eye contact, slow blink, soft lighting
[2-12s] BUILD: Pan down to shoulder, minimal clothing visible, confident posture
[12-35s] MAIN: Slow body movement, highlight curves, confident strut or recline
[35-55s] MOMENT: Direct camera look, subtle smile/lip bite, peak sensual energy
[55-58s] ENGAGEMENT: Flick of hair or clothing adjustment, break eye contact playfully
[58-60s] END: Logo reveal or text overlay

CONCEPT
- Styling: Silk/satin material, minimal jewelry
- Angles: 45° side angle for maximum silhouette, then direct to camera
- Lighting: Soft golden + subtle rim light
- Poses: Reclined confidence, intentional slow movements
- Vibe: Alluring, self-assured, magnetic
```

## Tips for Best Results

- **Timing is everything** - Every script uses the full 60 seconds for maximum impact
- **Confidence over technique** - The energy matters more than perfect execution
- **Use multiple takes** - Capture variations of each moment to edit best ones
- **Lighting is key** - Most sensual content works best with flattering, warm lighting
