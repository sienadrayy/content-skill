# Video Prompt Language Reference

Vocabulary for describing 4-second motion segments for i2v models. Each segment should be clear, specific, and optimized for smooth multi-clip assembly.

## Structure Template

Every video prompt follows this structure:

```
[Primary motion] [direction/type], [camera movement], [speed/intensity], [duration], [transition cue]
```

## Primary Motions

### Face/Head Motions
- **Eye contact hold** - Maintain direct gaze for duration

- **Slow transition** - Deliberate, extended movement between poses

## Camera Movements

### Camera Types
- **Fixed camera** - No camera movement, subject moves
- **Moving camera** - Camera itself moves

### Fixed Camera (Subject Moves)
- **Subject rotates** - Person spins/rotates in frame
- **Subject walks** - Movement through static frame
- **Subject poses** - Transition between poses without camera motion

### Moving Camera
- **Slow pan down** - Camera gradually moves downward
- **Pan up** - Camera moves upward
- **Pan left/right** - Camera moves horizontally
- **Tracking shot** - Camera follows subject movement
- **Zoom in** - Camera gets closer to subject
- **Zoom out** - Camera pulls back from subject
- **Slow dolly** - Smooth camera forward/back movement

### Combination Movements
- **Pan + subject motion** - Camera and subject move together
- **Zoom + subject holds** - Camera zooms while subject poses
- **Track + rotate** - Camera follows while subject rotates

## Speed & Intensity - AGGRESSIVE FOCUS

### Movement Speed (Updated for Fast Pacing)
- **Quick** - 0.5-1.5 seconds for motion (for teasing/reveals)
- **Fast** - 1-2 seconds, snappy and engaging
- **Medium-fast** - 2-3 seconds, confident purposeful motion
- **Held** - 2-3 seconds static pose (not slow, just HELD with confidence)
- **Continuous** - No pause, motion flows into next segment
- **Rapid pulse** - Quick micro-movements building intensity

**KEY:** Avoid "slow", "gentle", "subtle" - use FAST, CONFIDENT, INTENSE instead.

### Intensity Levels (Escalating)
- **Building** - Energy increasing from previous segment
- **Confident** - Strong, assured, knows-she's-hot movement
- **Intense** - Direct, powerful, sexual energy
- **Peak** - Maximum sensual/sexual moment
- **Dominating** - Commanding camera, ownership energy
- **Magnetic** - Pulls viewer in, can't look away

## Duration & Timing

### Segment Duration
- **4 seconds** - Standard segment length
- **Hold for 3 seconds** - Pose stays static for 3s
- **Transition in 1 second** - Quick change within segment
- **Held throughout** - Motion maintained for full duration

### Rhythm
- **Slow paced** - Extended, leisurely motion
- **Beat matched** - Synced to music tempo
- **Continuous** - No pause or break
- **With pause** - Held moment in middle
- **Accelerating** - Gets faster through segment
- **Decelerating** - Slows down toward end

## Expression & Engagement

### Eyes
- **Direct eye contact** - Looking straight at camera
- **Eyes held** - Gaze maintained throughout
- **Eyes intense** - Strong, confident gaze
- **Eyes soften** - Gaze becomes gentler
- **Eyes sparkle** - Highlight/catchlight in eyes
- **Blink naturally** - Organic blinking pattern

### Face/Mouth
- **Confident expression** - Assured, present energy

### Overall Engagement
- **Connected to camera** - Aware of audience
- **Intimate** - Personal, close connection
- **Playful** - Fun, teasing energy
- **Mysterious** - Guarded, intriguing
- **Confident** - Self-assured, powerful

## Transitions Between Segments

### Transition Types
- **Cut** - Abrupt change to next segment
- **Fade** - Dissolve to black then fade in next
- **Dissolve** - Smooth crossfade to next segment
- **Continuous** - Seamless flow to next motion
- **Match cut** - Visual similarity between segments
- **Hard cut** - Quick, no fade

### Transition Positioning
- **Fade to next** - End with fade to black
- **Cut to [next description]** - Hard transition to specific next moment
- **Continuous to [next motion]** - Flows directly into next movement
- **Hold final pose** - End pose stays static for transition

## Lighting Maintenance

### During Motion
- **Lighting preserved** - No changes to light during segment
- **Lighting consistent** - Same illumination throughout
- **Shadow movement** - Natural shadow changes as subject moves
- **Highlight maintained** - Key light direction steady
- **Warm light throughout** - Golden/warm tones preserved

## Complete Video Prompt Examples - AGGRESSIVE & FAST

### Example 1: HOOK - Direct Eye Contact + Lip Bite
```
Extreme close-up of siena's face, direct INTENSE eye contact locked with camera, confident expression building, at 1-second mark subtle but VISIBLE lip bite, hold intense stare for remaining 3 seconds, golden warm lighting on face, breathing subtly visible, magnetic and commanding energy, hard cut to next moment
```
*(Fast, immediate impact, specific micro-moment)*

### Example 2: REVEAL - Quick Pan Down
```
Fast camera pan down from close-up face to shoulders/upper chest, motion takes 2 seconds, siena maintains eye contact as long as visible, reveal minimal bikini top in frame, lighting catches exposed skin, ends on collarbone/chest reveal, confident energy maintained, cut to next
```
*(Quick reveal, not slow, specific end point)*

### Example 3: ESCALATION - Clothing Adjust
```
Quick reach toward bikini strap at 0.5-second mark, pull/adjust to show MORE chest and side rib area over next 1.5 seconds, direct eye contact throughout adjustment, return to power pose for final 2 seconds with intensified stare, golden lighting, end STRONG facing camera, hard cut to next
```
*(Fast micro-moment, specific action, escalates)*

### Example 4: BUILD - Body Roll with Curves
```
Smooth but CONFIDENT body roll rotation from side profile to front over 3.5 seconds, camera fixed, movement emphasizes curves and body shape, hand briefly touches collarbone during rotation, intense eye contact when facing camera, golden light catches curves throughout motion, end facing camera with power, cut to next
```
*(Specific motion, curve emphasis, confident energy)*

### Example 5: PEAK - Intense Stare Hold
```
Freeze on power pose facing camera, INTENSE direct eye contact for full 4 seconds, expression shows peak confidence and sexuality, subtle breathing visible on chest showing minimal coverage, hand near collarbone suggesting recent adjustment, lighting perfect on face and body, magnetic dominating energy, hard cut to power exit
```
*(Static but INTENSE, not boring, specific energy)*

### Example 6: ENGAGEMENT - Hair Pull Neck Expose
```
Quick reach toward hair at 0-second mark, pull hair back smoothly over 1.5 seconds to expose neck/collarbone MORE, maintain direct eye contact throughout motion, hand holds hair pulled back for final 2.5 seconds showing neck/throat/collarbone fully, confident knowing smile, golden light hits exposed neck, cut to next moment
```
*(Specific reveal moment, quick motion, escalates coverage)*

### Example 7: ESCALATION - 180 Rotation Show-Off
```
Confident 180-degree rotation over 3.5 seconds, start facing camera, rotate to show back/side profile emphasizing curves, camera fixed showing full body, lighting catches silhouette, rotate back to face camera in final second, end with direct intense eye contact and knowing expression, hard cut to next
```
*(Shows body from multiple angles quickly, builds momentum)*

### Example 8: POWER EXIT - Hold Peak + Breathing
```
Hold strongest power pose with minimal coverage fully visible, direct camera INTENSE eye contact for 3 seconds, visible breathing showing subtle chest rise/fall (indicates confidence and excitement), in final second add micro-micro-expression (pupils dilating or smile deepening), lighting perfect, magnetic commanding presence, freeze frame or fade to black
```
*(Specific physical details, hold peak moment strong)*

## Moment-to-Moment Flow Strategy

For smooth multi-segment assembly:

1. **Opening segment** - Establish look/pose, confidence
2. **Reveal segments** - Gradually show more, transitions between locations/angles
3. **Peak moment** - Sensual peak, maximum impact
4. **Engagement segments** - Direct camera connection moments
5. **Transition segments** - Movement that connects to next key moment
6. **Build segments** - Increasing energy/intensity
7. **Climactic moment** - Highest sensual peak
8. **Closing segments** - Maintain energy, smooth finish

## i2v Model Optimization

### Effective Prompts for i2v
- ✅ Specific motion descriptions work better than vague
- ✅ Duration specification (4 seconds) is critical
- ✅ Direction descriptors (pan, rotate, zoom) help consistency
- ✅ Lighting maintenance notes help transitions
- ✅ Expression/engagement descriptors improve quality
- ✅ Transition cues help multi-segment assembly

### Avoid
- ❌ Overly complex motion (stick to primary action)
- ❌ Conflicting motions (don't say "hold still" AND "walk")
- ❌ Vague timing (be specific: 3 seconds, not "quickly")
- ❌ Extreme camera movements (smooth, controlled motions)
- ❌ Sudden lighting changes (consistency preferred)
