## Session: Reel Generation Pipeline Iteration

### Completed Work
- ✅ "Midnight Temptation" concept: Engineered 7 image + 7 video prompts (2 versions: explicit + safer)
  - Explicit UUID: Images c6605a13-0f9a-408d-8827-d1745f8bb30a | Videos df82c393-70da-48f4-b330-b0a5832231a4
  - Safer UUID: Images 6405c0fa-a664-4cf0-95ab-d2f213d8e825 | Videos 852f1458-cf1b-4fab-bde0-c6e7983c3e38
- ✅ Created submit_dual_workflow.py (dual-submission + 5s gap pattern)
- ✅ Pulled latest workflow updates from git origin
- ✅ Restarted OpenClaw Gateway (operational)

### Refined Constraints
- Hook: 3 seconds max (not 10s)
- Heat progression: 6/10 (hook) → 7/10 → 8/10 → 8/10 → 9/10 (peak) → 8/10 → 8/10 (exit)
- No plateau (continuous escalation)
- Suggestive sensuality (not explicit), no nudity unless covered by lingerie/thong
- Character: Siena (mid-20s, olive skin, long black wavy hair)
- Styling: Oil sheen, dramatic chiaroscuro, rule of thirds

### Workflow Pattern (Locked)
- Image Node: 443 | Video Node: 436 | Output Name: Node 500 (identical for both)
- Submission: Image first → 5s wait → Video second (both parallel after)
- Prompt format: Newline-separated standalone strings (no cross-refs)

### Next Action
- User to request new concept from Grok Director
- Engineer 7 image + 7 video prompts
- Submit via submit_dual_workflow.py
