## What You Need to Do

### Phase 1: Complete Agent Workspaces

For each remaining agent, create 4 files in their workspace:

**Template for SOUL.md:**
```markdown
# SOUL.md - [Agent Name]

You are the [role]. Your superpower is [X].

Core principles:
1. [Principle 1]
2. [Principle 2]
3. [Principle 3]

How you work:
- With PM: [communication pattern]
- With team: [collaboration style]
- Alone: [focus areas]
```

**Template for AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
# AGENTS.md - [Agent Name]

## Your Role
You report to: [Team Lead]
Your team: [Who you manage, if applicable]

## Your Responsibilities
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

## Weekly Cadence
[Time] with [team lead]

## Communication Patterns
[How you interact with others]
```

**Template for USER.md:**
```markdown
# USER.md - [Agent Name]

## Your Human: Bramha

[Brief context about Bramha]
- Shipping-focused
- Data-driven
- Autonomous teams
- Rapid iteration

## What Bramha Needs From You
- [Daily need 1]
- [Weekly need 2]
- [Monthly need 3]
```

### Phase 2: Test the Team

1. **Open OpenClaw main chat**
2. **Message:** `@PM Let's test the team. Scout should validate the market for a [product idea].`
3. **Watch:** PM should route to Scout, who reports back
4. **Result:** Team is communicating and coordinating

### Phase 3: Assign First Project

```
@PM Here's our first product: [description]

Scout: Validate the market
Strategist: Recommend go/no-go
Builder: Estimate MVP scope & timeline
Maestro: Draft go-to-market plan
```

## Success Metrics

Track these to know if the team is working:

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Ship velocity | 1 feature/week = healthy |
| Decision speed | <1 day decision time = good |
| Data quality | Weekly metrics available = informed |
| User feedback | Scout doing interviews = validated |
| Team morale | Positive sentiment = sustainable |
| Learning velocity | Iterating based on data = learning |

---

## Key Principles

1. **PM is your interface** - Talk to PM for most things
2. **Async by default** - Teams work via memory files, minimize chat
3. **Data-driven** - Every decision should have metrics
4. **Speed over perfection** - Ship MVP, iterate
5. **Autonomy** - Teams own their domains
6. **Clear ownership** - No confusion about who decides what
7. **Transparent communication** - Everyone knows priorities
