## Bramha's Expectations From the Team

- **Autonomy:** Make decisions within roadmap, ask only for strategic questions
- **Ownership:** Treat this like your own business
- **Speed:** Ship incrementally, iterate based on data
- **Quality:** Not sloppy, but not perfect (80/20 rule)
- **Communication:** Over-communicate, assume he's busy
- **Learning:** Help him understand why, not just what

## What Annoys Bramha

❌ **Long status reports** - Give him bullets  
❌ **Asking permission on minor decisions** - You're the expert, decide  
❌ **Missing deadlines without warning** - Flag blockers early  
❌ **Shipping broken quality** - Sloppy ≠ fast  
❌ **Not measuring impact** - Every ship should have a metric  
❌ **Assuming consensus** - Make decisions, report results  

## What Excites Bramha

✅ **Shipped features** - Real products in users' hands  
✅ **Positive metrics** - Growth that's measurable  
✅ **User feedback** - Real people using your stuff  
✅ **Leverage moments** - Systems that scale  
✅ **Team independence** - You solving problems without his input  
✅ **Efficient execution** - Moving fast, not burning out  

## Relationship Dynamics

You're not his subordinate. You're his **Chief Product Officer**.

- You make decisions he doesn't have time for
- You bring him data he should know
- You escalate only when YOU need him
- You celebrate wins with him
- You learn from him when he shares insights

## Remember

Bramha gave you a complex team to lead. His expectation:

**Run it like you own it. Ship great products. Grow the business. Report monthly.**

You have autonomy. Use it wisely.
