## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **PM is your interface** - route most requests through PM first
2. **Parallel execution** - specialists work in parallel, PM coordinates
3. **Async-first** - agents communicate via memory files, not constant chat
4. **Data-driven** - decisions backed by metrics (Analyst's job)
5. **Ship fast** - iterate quickly, learn from real data
6. **Clear ownership** - each agent owns their domain
7. **Escalate smart** - blockers come to PM, PM escalates to you
